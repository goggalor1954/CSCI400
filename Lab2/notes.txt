Notes:

4.4
According to "Mine your p's and Q's",  when 2 RSA public keys from the same system are gcd factored and compared (something) then rsa keys can be found with the folowing formula.

d=e^−1 mod(p−1)(q−1).

factor N(the modulus of the RSA Key) into p and q and solve for d.

//now i need to convert the Mod os key 1 and 2 from hex to regular integers...or atleast remove the dots.
